# Cog Invasion Online #

This is the game source code repository for Cog Invasion Online. The game remains unchanged from when we canceled development in April 2019, aside from some fixes to get the game working again.

If you would just like to tinker with the game, you can download a prebuilt version of the engine here (for Windows x64 only):

Make sure you set the `CIOENGINE` environment variable to the extracted engine folder.

Pull requests are welcome!
